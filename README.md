# MotionMatching for Godot 4

This library is a generic implementation of Motion Matching inside the Godot Engine 4.2.

## Status

The project is currently in a working state but still under development. Please note that everything is subject to changes.

## Documentation

Documentation is currently missing. We are actively working on it.

## Demo

A demo is not available at this moment. We have a working demo with our assets and animations, but due to licensing restrictions, we cannot share them. We are working on creating a tutorial.

## About the Implementation

The implementation is based around the ideas described in [Simon Clavet's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcpIrw38E-s).

The goal of this library is to provide a generic set of utilities and ease the management of the data required for Motion Matching. It is extracted from my projects in the hope to help others and also provide a small framework for others to contribute.
