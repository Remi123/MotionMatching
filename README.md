# MotionMatching
Motion Matching for Godot 4. 

Version : 0.1
Status : Working but WIP. Everything is subject to changes
Documentation : Missing. Working on it.
Demo : Missing. I have a working demo with my assets and animations but I obviously cannot share them due to license. Working on tutorial.


This library is a generic implementation of Motion Matching inside the Godot Engine 4.1 

The implementation is based around the ideas described in [Simon Clavet's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcpIrw38E-s).

The goal of this library is to provide a generic set of utilities and ease the management of the data required for Motion Matching. It is extracted from my projects in the hope to help others and also provide a small framework for others to contribute.
